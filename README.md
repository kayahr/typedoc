# @kayahr/typedoc

[GitHub] | [NPM]

A drop-in replacement for [typedoc], bundling typedoc and its dependencies into a single module.

This package is primarily for my own use as a single dev dependency across my projects, to centralize the review of updates for the dependencies that typedoc brings along, and to reduce the threat of a supply-chain attack. Use at your own risk.

Usage
-----

Install as development dependency:

```
npm install -DE @kayahr/typedoc
```

Usage is the same as with the original [typedoc], so check upstream documentation for more info.
